### Some Information
Weilai is a card-game created in **48** hours for Clever Programmer's Website Jam Event.
The Website is currently hosted [here](weilai.vercel.app).
Weilai means 'future' in mandarin Chineese.

### The Aim of the Game
**Every hour the stats of your card decrease**. You have to trade your cards before it becomes worthless, and get to the top of the leaderboards.
That's pretty much it XD.

### Stack
It's built using the FEVNN Stack (Firebase, Express, Vercel, Next JS, Node JS). Express & Node are the Backend, Firebase is the Database, Vercel is the hosting service and Next JS is the Frontend. You could also include React, but then it'll become FEVRNN, which doesn't sound as cool if you ask me.
